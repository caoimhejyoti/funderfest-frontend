      <h1>All about FunderFest Events?</h1>
      <h2>What is FunderFest Events?</h2>
      <p>
        FunderFest Events was created to provide a platform for event creators
        to be able to host their events and gage the response. Users can create
        events, let their audience know the event details, sell tickets with the
        knowledge that the event is not a guarenteed until closer to the event.
        Think of this as the kickstarter for events.
      </p>

      <p>
        The name FunderFest Events comes from the idea of fundraising, having
        fun and going back to the events of our youth!
