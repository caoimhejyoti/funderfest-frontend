## About

https://main--frabjous-licorice-33173c.netlify.app/

### What is FunderFest?

This project aim was to create a crowdfunding website. I decided to work with my events and festival background and create a platform for event creators. Funderfest Events allows event creators to sell tickets to their event with the oportunity to get donations for the event as well.

### Intended Audience/User Stories

```md
AS AN event planner
I WANT a platform that allows people to purchase tickets to support my event
SO THAT I have the funding to progress with my event
```
